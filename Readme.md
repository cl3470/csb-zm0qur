# 808 Sequencer

## Colton Larson

When I set out on this project, I wanted to create a Drum Sequencer that had a separate effects chain for each drum. The original plan was to use 808 samples and the interface would be a Nexus UI Sequencer.

Throughout the process of making the Sequencer there were several choices that impacted the project. One of the main choices was which drums to incorporate. After some thought I decided to do a clap, hi-hat, snare, and kick.

The main challenge that I faced when doing this project was incorporating Nexus UI. After having several difficulties with the Nexus UI, I decided to scrap that part of the project and make a more simplistic way of incorporating a Sequencer
